I am a Research Scientist at <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/stability_ai.png" alt="Stability AI" class="inline-logo">[Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), I work on generative modeling for image, video, and 3D.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/mila_purple.png" alt="Mila" class="inline-logo">[Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/){:target="_blank"}, [University of Montreal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/){:target="_blank"}, I was supervised by [Prof. Christopher Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/){:target="_blank"}. My main research interests are at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning, my past research spans generative modeling and representation learning for image, video and 3D.
<!-- My projects include score-based diffusion probabilistic models for video prediction, generation, interpolation; multi-resolution image generation; self-supervised video prediction using dynamical modelling; 3D human pose estimation and inverse kinematics from videos. -->

<!-- I also work as an AI Advisor to [Blue Lion Labs](https://bluelionlabs.com/){:target="_blank"}. -->
During my PhD, I worked as a Research Intern at <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/meta2.png" alt="Meta" class="inline-logo">[Meta](https://meta.com),
<!-- where I worked on generation of video, 3D objects, 4D content from text. Before that, I was  a MITACS Research Intern at-->
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/unity_white.png" alt="Unity" class="inline-logo">[Unity Labs](https://unity.com/labs), and
<!-- I worked on 3D human pose estimation and inverse kinematics from video. In Fall 2019, I was a Research Intern at  -->
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/experience/Google__G__Logo.png" alt="Google" class="inline-logo">[Google](https://ai.google/research/teams/perception/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I worked in the engineering industry for 4 years.
 <!-- in the [Google AI Perception](https://ai.google/research/teams/perception/){:target="_blank"} team. -->
<!-- In 2019 and 2020, I was an AI Scientist in Residence at [NextAI](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-ai/){:target="_blank"}. -->

<!-- Previously, I worked as a Research Fellow with [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/){:target="_blank"} at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in){:target="_blank"} on automated lip synthesis for translation of a video into a different languages. I was a Mentor for the first [Foundations of AI/ML](https://www.talentsprint.com/aiml.dpl){:target="_blank"} certificate program for industry professionals by IIIT-H Machine Learning Lab. Prior to that, I worked at [GreyOrange Robotics](http://www.greyorange.com/){:target="_blank"} on real time embedded vision in videos for warehouse automation, and autonomous robots; and at [Airbus, India](http://www.airbus.com/){:target="_blank"} on software development and integration. -->

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, India](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, in 2014 with a Dual Degree (B.Tech. (H) + M.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering, my Master's specialization is Instrumentation and Signal Processing.
